ROUGH DESIGN FOR THE CRYPTO MARKET SIMULATOR APP:

STEP 1: 
Create a landing page which prompts the user to either login or register an account. For simplicity's sake, I think it should probably be mandatory
for users to be logged in to use this app, since we need to keep track of what they bought etc etc. Also templating will be easier without having to
make seperate buttons for users who are logged in/not logged in etc.

STEP 2:
Create a homepage/dashboard where users can see what their current holdings are.

* First we will need a HTML layout page with navbar etc, for other pages to inherit from
* Users should be able to see their current assets, along with the amount which each asset has risen/fallen in value since they bought it. (Charts?)
* Each asset will have its own <div> with the chart and also some info from wikipedia about that cryptocurrency
* Users should be able to do a "quick buy/sell" of any asset they own from this homepage (JS Fetch/AJAX)

STEP 3:
Create a "MyAccount" page where users can see statistics about their lifetime earnings/losses

* Users should be able to add money to their account from this page
* Users should be able to view all their transaction history here with dates, amounts etc

STEP 4:
Create a "Browse CryptoCurrency" page where users can select from a list of available coins

* When a user selects a coin, they should be taken to a page for that coin with information and the option to purchase (or sell if already owned)
* This page should also have the ability to get a quick quote for the coin (JS Fetch/Ajax)
